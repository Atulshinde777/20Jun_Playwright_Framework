🎓 Trainer's Guide — Building the Playwright Framework Step by Step (Live Coding)

> Purpose of this document: This is your complete teaching companion. It tells you where to start, what to build in every class, in what order, and why — so you can build this SauceDemo Data-Driven Playwright framework live, from an empty folder to a production-ready framework, while confidently explaining the purpose of every step.
>
> Golden rule for live teaching: _Never introduce a file before the pain it solves exists._ Let students feel the problem first, then introduce the solution. That is how the framework "earns" every folder and file.

How to Use This Guide

Each session below follows the same repeatable teaching pattern so students learn a rhythm:

| Block              | What you do                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Goal            | One sentence: what we build this session                  |
| 😖 The Pain        | The problem that makes this step necessary (demo it live) |
| 🛠️ Build Live      | Files to create, in order                                 |
| 💡 Why It Matters  | The concept/principle being taught                        |
| ✅ Best Practices  | Rules to drill in                                         |
| ⚠️ Common Mistakes | What students get wrong + the fix                         |
| 🧪 Run & Prove     | The command to run so students _see_ it work              |

> Tip: Keep the finished framework open in a second window as your "answer key," but type everything fresh in class. Students learn from watching you build (and recover from small mistakes), not from copy-paste.

The Teaching Philosophy

Students remember why, not what. So we build the framework the way it actually evolved in real life:

```
Plain test  →  it works but is messy  →  introduce a pattern to clean it  →  repeat
```

Every layer we add solves a concrete pain from the previous layer:

| Stage            | Pain from previous stage             | Solution we introduce         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1. Raw test      | Nothing yet                          | A single working test         |
| 2. POM           | Selectors copy-pasted everywhere     | Page Objects                  |
| 3. BasePage      | Same `click/fill` code in every page | A shared parent class         |
| 4. Config        | Hard-coded URLs & users              | Central config + environments |
| 5. Fixtures      | `new LoginPage(page)` in every test  | Fixtures inject objects       |
| 6. Utils         | Repeated waits, parsing, logging     | Reusable helpers              |
| 7. Data-driven   | One test per data set                | Loop over JSON data           |
| 8. Reporting     | "It failed" — but no evidence        | Logs, screenshots, Allure     |
| 9. Cross-browser | "Works on my Chrome"                 | Projects + parallel workers   |
| 10. Advanced     | Only functional coverage             | Unit tests                    |
| 11. CI/CD        | "Runs on my machine"                 | Jenkins, GitHub Actions       |

Write this table on the board on Day 1. It is the map of the whole course.

Session 0

🟢 The Very First Step (and Why)

> The very first step is NOT writing a test. It is creating and initializing the project with `npm init` and installing Playwright.

Why this is first:

1. A framework needs a home — a folder with a `package.json` that records every dependency and script. Without it, nothing is reproducible.
2. Playwright needs to be installed before any test can run.
3. It sets the professional tone: _"We build on a managed, versioned project — not loose script files."_

Build live (in an empty folder):

```powershell
# 1. Create and enter the project folder
mkdir saucedemo-framework
cd saucedemo-framework

# 2. Initialize the project — creates package.json
npm init -y

# 3. Install Playwright test runner
npm install -D @playwright/test

# 4. Download the browsers Playwright drives
npx playwright install
```

Then explain `package.json`: it is the identity card of the project — name, scripts, and the exact versions of every dependency. Add `"type": "module"` so we can use modern `import/export` syntax.

⚠️ Common mistake: Students skip `npm init` and just start writing `.js` files. Then nothing is reproducible and `npm install` later fails. Always initialize first.

✅ Best practice: Commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to Git. Never commit `node_modules/`.

Session-by-Session Build Plan

---

<a id="session-1"></a>
🧩 Session 1 — Project Setup & Your First Test

🎯 Goal: Get one real test running against SauceDemo, with a minimal config.

😖 The Pain: "We have Playwright installed — but how do we prove it works? And where do tests live?"

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `playwright.config.js` — start minimal, grow it later:
   ```javascript
   import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

   export default defineConfig({
     testDir: "./tests",
     use: {
       baseURL: "https://www.saucedemo.com",
       headless: true,
     },
   });
   ```
2. `tests/login/positiveLogin.spec.js` — a raw test with selectors inline (deliberately messy):
   ```javascript
   import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

   test("valid user can log in", async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto("/");
     await page.fill("#user-name", "standard_user");
     await page.fill("#password", "secret_sauce");
     await page.click("#login-button");
     await expect(page.locator(".title")).toHaveText("Products");
   });
   ```

💡 Why It Matters:

- `defineConfig` gives type hints and one place for global settings.
- `baseURL` lets tests use `page.goto('/')` instead of full URLs.
- `testDir` tells Playwright where to discover specs.

✅ Best Practices:

- Organize tests by feature folder (`tests/login/`) from day one.
- Name specs `*.spec.js` so Playwright auto-discovers them.
- One assertion per behavior; use web-first assertions (`await expect(...)`).

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Using `page.waitForTimeout(5000)` "to be safe" — teach auto-waiting instead.
- Forgetting `await` before Playwright calls — everything is async.
- Hard-coding the full `https://...` URL instead of using `baseURL`.

🧪 Run & Prove:

```powershell
npx playwright test
npx playwright show-report
```

> Teaching beat: Now point at the inline selectors and ask: _"If SauceDemo changes the login button ID, and we have 50 tests — how many files do we edit?"_ That pain sets up Session 2.

---

<a id="session-2"></a>
🧩 Session 2 — Page Object Model (POM)

🎯 Goal: Move selectors and actions out of tests into Page Object classes.

😖 The Pain (from S1): Selectors are duplicated across tests; one UI change breaks everything; tests read like robot instructions, not business steps.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `pages/LoginPage.js`:
   ```javascript
   import { ROUTES } from "../utils/constants.js"; // add constants later; hardcode '/' for now

   export class LoginPage {
     constructor(page) {
       this.page = page;
       this.usernameInput = page.getByPlaceholder("Username");
       this.passwordInput = page.locator("#password");
       this.loginButton = page.getByRole("button", { name: "Login" });
       this.errorMessage = page.locator('[data-test="error"]');
     }
     async open() {
       await this.page.goto("/");
     }
     async login(username, password) {
       await this.usernameInput.fill(username);
       await this.passwordInput.fill(password);
       await this.loginButton.click();
     }
     async getErrorMessage() {
       return this.errorMessage.textContent();
     }
   }
   ```
2. `pages/InventoryPage.js` — the products page (title, add-to-cart, sort dropdown, cart badge).
3. Refactor the S1 test to use the page object:
   ```javascript
   test("valid user can log in", async ({ page }) => {
     const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
     await loginPage.open();
     await loginPage.login("standard_user", "secret_sauce");
     await expect(page.locator(".title")).toHaveText("Products");
   });
   ```

💡 Why It Matters: POM separates "what the page can do" (page object) from "what we are testing" (spec). Selectors live in exactly one place.

✅ Best Practices:

- Locators are defined once in the constructor, never inline in tests.
- Methods return data or nothing — never assertions inside page objects (assertions belong in tests).
- Prefer role/label/placeholder locators (`getByRole`, `getByPlaceholder`) over brittle XPath. Show a mix so students know all strategies.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Putting `expect()` assertions inside page objects (couples pages to test logic).
- Creating one giant `Pages.js` file instead of one class per page.
- Re-declaring locators inside methods instead of the constructor.

🧪 Run & Prove: Same test passes, but now change a selector in one place and show all tests still work.

> Teaching beat: Open `LoginPage` and `InventoryPage` side by side. Both have `click`, `fill`, `getText`... _"We're copying the same low-level code into every page. Can we share it?"_ → Session 3.

---

<a id="session-3"></a>
🧩 Session 3 — BasePage (Inheritance & DRY)

🎯 Goal: Create a `BasePage` parent that all page objects extend, holding shared, logged action wrappers.

😖 The Pain (from S2): Every page repeats the same `await locator.click()`, `await locator.fill()`, waits, and (soon) logging.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `pages/BasePage.js`:
   ```javascript
   export class BasePage {
     constructor(page) {
       this.page = page;
     }

     // Accepts a string selector OR a Locator — polymorphic helper
     _resolve(locator) {
       return typeof locator === "string"
         ? this.page.locator(locator)
         : locator;
     }

     async goto(path) {
       await this.page.goto(path);
     }
     async click(locator) {
       await this._resolve(locator).click();
     }
     async fill(locator, text) {
       const el = this._resolve(locator);
       await el.fill(text);
     }
     async getText(locator) {
       return this._resolve(locator).textContent();
     }
     async isVisible(locator) {
       return this._resolve(locator).isVisible();
     }
     async count(locator) {
       return this._resolve(locator).count();
     }
     async selectByValue(locator, value) {
       await this._resolve(locator).selectOption(value);
     }
     // ...grow to ~30 wrappers as pain appears
   }
   ```
2. Update each page to extend it:
   ```javascript
   import { BasePage } from "./BasePage.js";

   export class LoginPage extends BasePage {
     constructor(page) {
       super(page);
       this.usernameInput = page.getByPlaceholder("Username");
       // ...
     }
     async login(username, password) {
       await this.fill(this.usernameInput, username);
       await this.fill(this.passwordInput, password);
       await this.click(this.loginButton);
     }
   }
   ```

💡 Why It Matters: This is where you teach the four OOP pillars live:

- Inheritance — every page `extends BasePage`.
- Encapsulation — locators are private details of each page.
- Polymorphism — `_resolve()` accepts a string _or_ a Locator; children can override methods.
- Abstraction — tests call `login()`, not raw Playwright.

✅ Best Practices:

- Put only generic, reusable actions in `BasePage`. Page-specific logic stays in child pages.
- One choke point (`_resolve`, later logging) means you can add cross-cutting behavior in one place.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Forgetting `super(page)` in the child constructor → `this.page` is undefined.
- Putting page-specific locators/methods in `BasePage`.
- Over-engineering `BasePage` with 100 methods on day one — grow it as needed.

🧪 Run & Prove: All tests still pass, but now every page shares one implementation of `click/fill/getText`.

<a id="session-4"></a>
🧩 Session 4 — Configuration & Environments

🎯 Goal: Remove hard-coded URLs, users, and timeouts. Support `dev` / `qa` / `staging`.

😖 The Pain (from S3): `'standard_user'`, `'secret_sauce'`, and `'https://www.saucedemo.com'` are scattered in tests and pages. Switching environments means find-and-replace.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `config/environments/qa.json`, `dev.json`, `staging.json` — per-env base URLs, credentials.
2. `config/env.config.js` — reads `process.env.ENV` (default `qa`), loads the matching JSON, merges `.env` overrides, exports one typed `env` object (`baseURL`, `password`, `users`, `timeouts`, `headless`, `logLevel`).
3. `.env.example` (committed) + `.env` (local, git-ignored) via `dotenv`.
4. Wire config into `playwright.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   import { env } from "./config/env.config.js";
   export default defineConfig({
     use: { baseURL: env.baseURL, headless: env.headless },
     timeout: env.timeouts.test,
     expect: { timeout: env.timeouts.expect },
   });
   ```
5. `utils/constants.js` — routes, messages, sort options, expected counts (no more magic strings).

💡 Why It Matters: Configuration is externalized. The same test code runs against any environment by changing one variable: `ENV=staging`.

✅ Best Practices:

- Never commit secrets — `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` documents the shape.
- Provide safe defaults so the framework runs even without a `.env`.
- Centralize every magic string in `constants.js`.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Committing `.env` with real credentials.
- Reading `process.env` directly in tests instead of the central `env` object.
- Hard-coding timeouts in tests instead of `env.timeouts`.

🧪 Run & Prove:

```powershell
$env:ENV="staging"; npx playwright test
```

<a id="session-5"></a>
🧩 Session 5 — Fixtures (Dependency Injection)

🎯 Goal: Stop writing `new LoginPage(page)` in every test. Let Playwright inject ready-to-use page objects.

😖 The Pain (from S4): Every test begins with 4–5 lines of `const loginPage = new LoginPage(page); const inventoryPage = ...`. Repetitive and error-prone.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `fixtures/baseFixture.js` — extend Playwright's base test:
   ```javascript
   import { test as base, expect } from "@playwright/test";
   import { LoginPage } from "../pages/LoginPage.js";
   import { InventoryPage } from "../pages/InventoryPage.js";
   import { env } from "../config/env.config.js";

   const test = base.extend({
     loginPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
       await use(new LoginPage(page));
     },
     inventoryPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
       await use(new InventoryPage(page));
     },

     // Auto-login fixture for tests that need an authenticated session
     loggedInPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
       const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
       await loginPage.open();
       await loginPage.login(env.users.standard, env.password);
       await page.waitForURL(/inventory/);
       await use(page);
     },
   });

   export { test, expect };
   ```
2. Add a global `afterEach` in the fixture to attach a screenshot on failure.
3. Refactor tests to import `test` from the fixture, not from `@playwright/test`:
   ```javascript
   import { test, expect } from "../../fixtures/baseFixture.js";

   test("valid login", async ({ loginPage, inventoryPage }) => {
     await loginPage.open();
     await loginPage.login("standard_user", "secret_sauce");
     expect(await inventoryPage.isLoaded()).toBeTruthy();
   });
   ```

💡 Why It Matters: Fixtures are Playwright's dependency injection. Setup/teardown happens automatically and consistently. `loggedInPage` removes login boilerplate from every non-login test.

✅ Best Practices:

- Each fixture is lazy — only created when a test asks for it.
- Put shared setup (auto-login, data generator) here.
- Always export a single `{ test, expect }` from the fixture as the team's entry point.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Importing `test` from `@playwright/test` in some specs and the fixture in others → confusing, inconsistent.
- Doing heavy work in a fixture that most tests don't need (slows everything).
- Forgetting to `await use(...)` — the fixture won't provide its value.

🧪 Run & Prove: Tests are now 3–4 lines shorter each; login tests still work.

<a id="session-6"></a>
🧩 Session 6 — Utilities Layer

🎯 Goal: Extract repeated logic (waits, parsing, data generation, assertions) into reusable `utils/`.

😖 The Pain (from S5): Tests re-implement price parsing (`$29.99` → `29.99`), custom retry loops, and repeated assertion patterns.

🛠️ Build Live (introduce each as its pain appears):

| File                                 | Introduce when students need...                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `utils/waitUtils.js`                 | a flaky action to retry → `retry()`, `waitUntil()`, `sleep()`           |
| `utils/stringUtils.js`               | to compare prices/sorting → `parsePrice()`, `toCurrency()`, `slugify()` |
| `utils/dataGenerator.js`             | unique test data → `randomInt()`, `email()`, `customer()`               |
| `utils/assertionUtils.js`            | readable, logged checks → `assertEquals()`, `assertVisible()`           |
| `utils/dateUtils.js`, `fileUtils.js` | date formatting / file I/O when needed                                  |

Example — `waitUtils.js`:

```javascript
export async function retry(
  fn,
  { retries = 3, delay = 1000, name = "action" } = {},
) {
  let lastError;
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (err) {
      lastError = err;
      if (attempt < retries) await sleep(delay);
    }
  }
  throw lastError;
}
```

💡 Why It Matters: Utilities keep tests and pages thin and readable. Logic is written once, tested once, reused everywhere.

✅ Best Practices:

- Keep utils pure and framework-agnostic where possible (easy to unit-test — see Session 10).
- No third-party bloat: `dataGenerator` replaces Faker; native `fetch`/Playwright request replaces Axios.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Turning `utils/` into a dumping ground of unrelated functions — group by concern.
- Building helpers nobody uses yet ("You Aren't Gonna Need It" — build on demand).

🧪 Run & Prove: Use `parsePrice` in an inventory sort test to prove numeric sorting works.

<a id="session-7"></a>
🧩 Session 7 — Data-Driven Testing

🎯 Goal: Run the same test logic across many data sets from external JSON.

😖 The Pain (from S6): We have separate copy-pasted tests for invalid username, invalid password, empty username, locked-out user... They differ only by data.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `test-data/loginData.json` — arrays of scenarios (`testId`, `username`, `password`, `expectedError`).
2. `test-data/checkoutData.json`, `users.json`, `products.json`.
3. `utils/dataReader.js` — `readJSON(fileName)` / `readCSV(fileName)`.
4. Loop to generate tests dynamically:
   ```javascript
   import { readJSON } from "../../utils/dataReader.js";
   const data = readJSON("loginData.json");

   for (const scenario of data.invalidCredentials) {
     test(`${scenario.testId}: ${scenario.description}`, async ({
       loginPage,
     }) => {
       await loginPage.open();
       await loginPage.login(scenario.username, scenario.password);
       expect(await loginPage.getErrorMessage()).toContain(
         scenario.expectedError,
       );
     });
   }
   ```

💡 Why It Matters: This is the "Data-Driven" in the framework's name. Test data is separated from test logic. Adding a scenario = adding a JSON row, not code.

✅ Best Practices:

- Give every data row a stable `testId` for traceability.
- Keep expected results (`expectedError`) in the data, not the code.
- Loop outside `test()` so each row becomes its own reported test.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Putting the loop inside one `test()` — a single failure hides the rest and you get one giant test.
- Hard-coding data in the spec instead of JSON.
- Reusing mutable data across tests (each test should be independent).

🧪 Run & Prove: Show the report now lists one line per data scenario.

---

<a id="session-8"></a>
🧩 Session 8 — Logging & Reporting

🎯 Goal: Turn "it failed" into actionable evidence: structured logs, screenshots, videos, traces, and rich reports.

😖 The Pain (from S7): A test failed on CI. Why? No logs, no screenshot, no idea.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `utils/logger.js` — Winston logger → colored console + `logs/test-execution.log` + `logs/error.log`. Wire it into `BasePage` so every action is logged.
2. Add reporters + artifacts in `playwright.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   reporter: [
     ['list'],
     ['html', { outputFolder: 'reports/html-report' }],
     ['json', { outputFile: 'reports/json-report/results.json' }],
     ['junit', { outputFile: 'reports/junit-report/results.xml' }],
     ['allure-playwright', { outputFolder: 'reports/allure-results' }],
   ],
   use: {
     screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
     video: 'retain-on-failure',
     trace: 'retain-on-failure',
   },
   ```
3. `global-setup.js` — write Allure `environment.properties` (env, browser, Node, OS).
4. Install `allure-playwright` + `allure-commandline`; add scripts:
   ```json
   "allure:serve": "allure serve reports/allure-results"
   ```

💡 Why It Matters:

- Logs tell the story of execution.
- Screenshots/videos/traces show the exact failure state.
- Trace Viewer (built-in, no third-party lib) is a time-travel debugger — DOM snapshots, network, console per step.
- Allure/JUnit/JSON integrate with CI dashboards.

✅ Best Practices:

- Use `*-on-failure` modes so artifacts don't bloat successful runs.
- Tag tests (`@smoke`, `@regression`) so reports and runs can be filtered.
- Keep `reports/` and `logs/` git-ignored.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Setting `trace: 'on'` always → huge disk usage. Use `retain-on-failure`.
- `console.log` debugging instead of the structured logger.
- Committing the generated `reports/` folder.

🧪 Run & Prove:

```powershell
npx playwright test        # let one test fail on purpose
npx playwright show-trace  # open the trace of the failure
npm run allure:serve
```

🧩 Session 9 — Cross-Browser & Parallel Execution

🎯 Goal: Run the suite on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, in parallel, with CI retries.

😖 The Pain (from S8): "It works on my Chrome" — but does it work on Firefox/Safari? And the suite is slow run serially.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. Add `projects[]` to `playwright.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   projects: [
     { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
     { name: 'firefox',  use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
     { name: 'webkit',   use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
   ],
   ```
2. Enable parallelism & CI-aware settings:
   ```javascript
   fullyParallel: true,
   workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : undefined,
   retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
   ```
3. Add browser-specific npm scripts (`test:chromium`, `test:firefox`, `test:webkit`).

💡 Why It Matters: Real users use different browsers. Parallelism cuts execution time dramatically. Retries on CI absorb transient flakiness without masking real bugs (retry only on CI, never locally where you want to _see_ flakiness).

✅ Best Practices:

- Tests must be independent (no shared state) to run in parallel safely.
- `retries` only on CI; `0` locally.
- Let workers auto-scale locally; cap them on CI for stability.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Tests that depend on execution order break under parallelism.
- Shared logged-in state / shared files causing race conditions.
- Setting high retries to "fix" flaky tests instead of fixing the root cause.

🧪 Run & Prove:

```powershell
npx playwright test                    # all browsers, parallel
npx playwright test --project=firefox  # single browser
```

<a id="session-10"></a>
🧩 Session 10 — Unit Testing

🎯 Goal: Broaden coverage beyond functional flows.

😖 The Pain (from S9): Functional tests pass, but our own utility helpers are untested — a broken helper can silently break many UI tests.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. Unit tests — `tests/unit/*.unit.spec.js` for `waitUtils`, `stringUtils`, `dateUtils`, `dataGenerator` (pure-logic tests, no browser).

💡 Why It Matters: A production framework tests behavior and its own helpers. Unit-testing utils proves the framework's foundation is solid.

✅ Best Practices:

- Keep unit tests fast and browser-free.
- Test edge cases (empty strings, boundary dates, etc.).

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Skipping utility tests because "they're just helpers" — they're used everywhere.

🧪 Run & Prove:

```powershell
npx playwright test tests/unit
```

<a id="session-11"></a>
🧩 Session 11 — CI/CD

🎯 Goal: Run the suite automatically on every push.

😖 The Pain (from S10): "It runs on my machine." Different Node versions, no automated runs on merge.

🛠️ Build Live (in order):

1. `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` — GitHub Actions with a browser matrix, runs on push/PR, uploads report artifacts.
2. `Jenkinsfile` — parametrized pipeline (`BROWSER`, `SUITE`) with stages: Checkout → Install Deps → Install Browsers → Run Tests → Generate Reports → Archive.

💡 Why It Matters: CI/CD makes testing continuous and reproducible. This is what makes the framework production-ready.

✅ Best Practices:

- Use `npm ci` (not `npm install`) in CI for reproducible installs from the lockfile.
- Always archive reports/artifacts as CI outputs.
- Set `CI=true` so retries and capped workers kick in.

⚠️ Common Mistakes:

- Forgetting `npx playwright install --with-deps` in CI (missing system libs).
- Not uploading artifacts — failures become undebuggable.
- Running headed in CI (must be headless).

🧪 Run & Prove:

```powershell
npm run test:smoke
npm run allure:serve
```

<a id="session-12"></a>
🧩 Session 12 — Final Execution Flow & Wrap-Up

🎯 Goal: Run the entire framework end to end and trace exactly what happens at each stage.

🛠️ Do Live:

```powershell
npm run test:smoke        # fast critical-path run
npm test                  # full suite, all browsers, parallel
npm run allure:serve      # rich report
```

Then walk the class through the [Final Execution Flow](#final-execution-flow) diagram below, mapping each stage to the file that implements it.

💡 Wrap-Up message to students: _"We started with one messy test. Every folder we added solved a real pain. That's how real frameworks are born — not designed all at once, but grown deliberately."_

Common Mistakes Students Make

A consolidated list to keep on a slide — revisit these throughout the course:

| #   | Mistake                                         | Fix                                                |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Skipping `npm init` and writing loose scripts   | Always initialize the project first                |
| 2   | Hard-coding selectors in tests                  | Move to Page Objects (POM)                         |
| 3   | `waitForTimeout(5000)` everywhere               | Trust auto-waiting / web-first assertions          |
| 4   | Missing `await` on async calls                  | Every Playwright call is awaited                   |
| 5   | Assertions inside Page Objects                  | Assertions belong in specs                         |
| 6   | Forgetting `super(page)` in child pages         | Always call `super()` first                        |
| 7   | Hard-coded URLs/users/timeouts                  | Centralize in `config/env.config.js`               |
| 8   | Committing `.env` with secrets                  | Git-ignore `.env`; commit `.env.example`           |
| 9   | Data loop inside one `test()`                   | Loop outside `test()` — one test per row           |
| 10  | Leaving `test.only` in code                     | Remove before commit; `forbidOnly` blocks it in CI |
| 11  | `trace: 'on'` always                            | Use `retain-on-failure`                            |
| 12  | Order-dependent tests                           | Keep tests independent for parallelism             |
| 13  | High retries to hide flakiness                  | Fix the root cause; retry only on CI               |
| 14  | Committing `node_modules/`, `reports/`, `logs/` | Git-ignore generated folders                       |
| 15  | `npm install` in CI                             | Use `npm ci` for reproducibility                   |

Final Execution Flow

When you run `npm test`, this is the journey — map each stage to its file:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. CLI: `npm test`  →  runs `playwright test` (package.json script)     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Playwright reads playwright.config.js                               │
│    • testDir, timeout, retries, workers, reporters, projects, use{}    │
│    • baseURL/headless pulled from config/env.config.js (reads ENV)     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. global-setup.js runs ONCE  →  writes Allure environment.properties  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Test discovery: finds all *.spec.js under tests/                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 5. Worker allocation: fullyParallel spreads tests across workers,      │
│    once per project (chromium / firefox / webkit)                      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 6. For each test:                                                      │
│    a. Browser context + page launched                                  │
│    b. Fixtures resolve (baseFixture.js): loginPage, inventoryPage,     │
│       loggedInPage (auto-login), api, data                             │
│    c. Data-driven specs read JSON via utils/dataReader.js              │
│    d. Test body runs → Page Objects → BasePage actions → Winston logs  │
│    e. Assertions auto-retry until expect.timeout                       │
│    f. afterEach: on failure → screenshot/video/trace attached          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 7. Retries (CI only): failed tests re-run up to `retries`             │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 8. Reporters emit output:                                             │
│    list (console) • HTML • JSON • JUnit XML • Allure results          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 9. View results:                                                     │
│    npx playwright show-report   |   npm run allure:serve             │
│    npx playwright show-trace <trace.zip>  (time-travel debugging)     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

From first test to full suite:

```
Write test → run single (npx playwright test file) → debug (--debug / trace)
   → tag it (@smoke) → run suite (npm test) → view report (allure:serve)
   → commit → push (CI runs matrix) → artifacts archived
```

Trainer's Quick Checklist

Print this and keep it beside you each class:

- [ ] Session 0–1: `npm init`, install Playwright, minimal config, first raw test passes.
- [ ] Session 2–3: Refactor to POM, then extract `BasePage` (teach OOP live).
- [ ] Session 4: Externalize config + environments; `ENV=staging` switch works.
- [ ] Session 5: Fixtures inject page objects; `loggedInPage` auto-login works.
- [ ] Session 6: Utilities extracted (`waitUtils`, `stringUtils`, `dataGenerator`).
- [ ] Session 7: Data-driven login/checkout from JSON; one test per row in report.
- [ ] Session 8: Winston logs + screenshots/video/trace + Allure report.
- [ ] Session 9: Cross-browser projects, parallel workers, CI retries.
- [ ] Session 10: Unit tests added.
- [ ] Session 11: GitHub Actions, Jenkinsfile — CI green.
- [ ] Session 12: Full suite runs end to end; walk the execution flow diagram.

Remember: Build by pain, explain the _why_, run after every step, and let the framework earn each file. Good luck in class! 🎓

```

```

1. What is Prettier?

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It automatically formats code according to consistent formatting rules.

For example, it can standardize indentation, spacing, quotes, line breaks, and trailing commas.

Before Prettier
const {test,expect}=require('@playwright/test')
test('Login Test',async({page})=>{
await page.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com')
const username=page.locator('#user-name')
await username.fill('standard_user')
})
After Prettier
const { test, expect } = require("@playwright/test");

test("Login Test", async ({ page }) => {
await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com");
const username = page.locator("#user-name");
await username.fill("standard_user");
});

The formatted code performs the same operations; the main difference is readability and consistency.

Why do we use Prettier?

Maintains consistent code formatting across the team.

Automatically fixes indentation and spacing.

Makes code reviews easier.

Reduces debates about formatting preferences.

Formats JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, HTML, and Markdown.

Helps keep large automation frameworks organized.

Important interview point: Prettier focuses on formatting. It does not primarily check whether variables are undefined, unused, or whether your test logic is correct.

2. How to install and configure Prettier
   Step 1: Install

Run this command in the project root:

npm install --save-dev prettier

--save-dev installs Prettier as a development dependency, because it is a development tool rather than an application runtime requirement.

Step 2: Add scripts in package.json

Add these inside your existing "scripts" object. Keep your other scripts unchanged.

{
"scripts": {
"format": "prettier --write .",
"format:check": "prettier --check ."
}
}

If you already have a "scripts" section, add only the two script entries rather than creating a second "scripts" object.

Step 3: Execute commands

Command

Purpose

npm run format

Formats supported files in the project

npm run format:check

Checks formatting without changing files

npx prettier --write tests/login.spec.js

Formats one specific file

npx prettier --check tests/login.spec.js

Checks one file for formatting issues

npx prettier --version

Displays the installed version

--write modifies the files. --check only reports whether files match the formatting rules.

3. What is .prettierignore?

The .prettierignore file tells Prettier which files and directories it should skip while formatting.

In a Playwright framework, many folders contain generated reports, test results, dependencies, screenshots, and logs. We generally do not want Prettier to process these generated files.

Recommended .prettierignore

Create this file in the project root, alongside package.json.

# Dependencies

node_modules/

# Environment files

.env
.env.*

# Logs

logs/
*.log

# Test results

test-results/
playwright-report/
allure-results/
allure-report/

# Generated reports

reports/
html-report/
json-report/
junit-report/
coverage/

# Screenshots and videos

screenshot/
screenshots/
videos/

# Package lock file

package-lock.json

# Temporary files

*.tmp
*.temp

# Build output

dist/
build/
Explanation of important entries

Entry

Purpose

node_modules/

Skips installed npm packages

.env

Skips environment variables and secrets

.env.*

Skips environment-specific files matching this pattern

logs/

Skips generated log files in the logs directory

*.log

Skips files ending in .log

test-results/

Skips Playwright test artifacts

playwright-report/

Skips generated Playwright HTML reports

allure-results/

Skips raw Allure results

allure-report/

Skips generated Allure reports

screenshots/

Skips generated screenshots

dist/, build/

Skips build output directories

Important: .prettierignore and .gitignore serve different purposes.

.prettierignore tells Prettier what not to format.

.gitignore tells Git what not to track as unignored files.

Neither file deletes files.

Also, .env contains secrets in many projects, so it should normally be listed in .gitignore as well. Ignoring it only in Prettier does not protect it from being committed.

4. What is ESLint?

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for JavaScript. It analyzes source code to identify potential errors, suspicious patterns, unused variables, undefined names, and violations of coding rules—without executing your Playwright tests.

Example: Code with an error
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("Login Test", async ({ page }) => {
const username = "standard_user";
const password = "secret_sauce";

await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com");
console.log(usernme); //erro
});

The variable is declared as username, but the code uses usernme.

ESLint can report that usernme is not defined. It can also warn that password and possibly expect are unused.

Why do we use ESLint?

Detects undefined variables and common coding mistakes.

Warns about unused variables and imports.

Enforces coding standards across a team.

Helps identify suspicious or potentially error-prone code.

Can automatically fix certain rule violations.

Helps detect issues before the code reaches CI/CD.

Important interview point: ESLint does not prove that your application or test logic is correct. It analyzes source code according to configured rules. A test can pass linting and still fail at runtime.

5. How to install and configure ESLint
   Step 1: Install ESLint
   npm install --save-dev eslint
   Step 2: Understand eslint.config.js

Your project uses the modern flat configuration format. Here is an example with explanations.

export default [
{
files: ["**/*.js"],

    ignores: [
      "node_modules/**",
      "reports/**",
      "test-results/**",
      "playwright-report/**",
      "allure-report/**",
      "allure-results/**",
      "html-report/**",
      "json-report/**",
      "junit-report/**",
    ],

    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: "latest",
      sourceType: "module",

      globals: {
        console: "readonly",
        process: "readonly",
        require: "readonly",
        __dirname: "readonly",
        __filename: "readonly",
        module: "readonly",
        exports: "readonly",
        Buffer: "readonly",
        setTimeout: "readonly",
        clearTimeout: "readonly",
        setInterval: "readonly",
        clearInterval: "readonly",
        global: "readonly",
        window: "readonly",
        document: "readonly",
      },
    },

    rules: {
      "no-unused-vars": "warn",
      "no-undef": "error",
      "no-console": "off",
    },

},
];
Explanation of every major property

Property

Meaning

export default

Exports the configuration for ESLint to load

files: ["**/*.js"]

Applies this configuration to JavaScript files matching the pattern

ignores

Excludes specified files and directories from this configuration

languageOptions

Configures the JavaScript language features and execution environment

ecmaVersion: "latest"

Allows the latest ECMAScript syntax supported by ESLint

sourceType: "module"

Treats files as ES modules using import and export

globals

Lists runtime globals ESLint should recognize

"readonly"

Allows reading a global but not assigning a new value to it

rules

Defines the code-quality rules to enforce

Explanation of the three rules

no-unused-vars: "warn"

const username = "standard_user";

If username is never used, ESLint warns about the unused variable.

no-undef: "error"

console.log(usernme);

If usernme is not declared or recognized as a global, ESLint reports an error.

no-console: "off"

console.log("Login test started");

This allows console statements without ESLint warnings. You might choose to turn this rule on in production application code, but console usage can be useful for debugging automation tests.

Step 3: Add ESLint scripts to package.json
{
"scripts": {
"lint": "eslint .",
"lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
}
}

Again, merge these into your existing "scripts" section rather than replacing existing scripts.

Step 4: Run ESLint

Command

Purpose

npm run lint

Checks code against the configured rules

npm run lint:fix

Applies automatic fixes where supported

npx eslint tests/login.spec.js

Checks one file

npx eslint --version

Displays the installed version

--fix does not fix every error. For example, it cannot safely determine the correct spelling of every undefined variable.

Interview answer: What is the difference between Prettier and ESLint?

Sample answer:

“Prettier is used to maintain consistent code formatting, such as indentation, spacing, quotes, and line breaks. ESLint is used for static code analysis to detect issues such as undefined variables, unused variables, and violations of coding rules. In my Playwright framework, I use Prettier for formatting and ESLint for code-quality checks. Together, they improve code readability and help identify issues before test execution or code review.”

Can Prettier and ESLint be used together?

Yes. They complement each other.

Playwright Source Code
|
v
Prettier
(Formatting)
|
v
ESLint
(Static Analysis)
|
v
Playwright Tests
(Execution)
|
v
CI/CD Pipeline

The order above is an illustrative workflow, not a mandatory technical sequence. ESLint and Prettier can run independently, and CI pipelines often run checks before executing tests.

7. Real-time example in a Playwright framework

Imagine your team has 10 automation engineers working on the same framework. Each engineer writes code differently.

One engineer uses single quotes, another uses double quotes. One uses four spaces for indentation, another uses two. Some developers forget unused imports or introduce misspelled variable names.

Prettier standardizes formatting, while ESLint catches configured code-quality issues.

Example source file
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("Verify SauceDemo login", async ({ page }) => {
const username = "standard_user";
const password = "secret_sauce";

await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com");
await page.locator("#user-name").fill(username);
await page.locator("#password").fill(password);
await page.locator("#login-button").click();

await expect(page).toHaveURL(/inventory/);
});

In this example:

Prettier formats the source consistently.

ESLint checks variables, imports, and configured rules.

Playwright executes the test and verifies the URL.

The test assertion checks application behavior, which is different from a linting check.

A successful lint or format check does not guarantee that the locator works or that the login succeeds.

8. Recommended package.json scripts

For your automation framework, a useful set of scripts could look like this:

{
"scripts": {
"test:e2e": "playwright test tests/E2E",
"lint": "eslint .",
"lint:fix": "eslint . --fix",
"format": "prettier --write .",
"format:check": "prettier --check .",
"test:smoke": "playwright test --grep @smoke",
"test:regression": "playwright test --grep @regression"
}
}

Keep the scripts you already have and add only the ones you need. Ensure the test paths and tags match your actual project.

What happens when you run these commands?

npm run format

Prettier formats eligible files in the project, respecting its ignore rules.

npm run lint

ESLint checks the applicable files against the rules in eslint.config.js.

npm run test:e2e

Playwright executes tests in the configured test directory.

9. How to run checks before committing code

For example, before creating a pull request, you can run:

npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run test:e2e

If the formatting check fails, format the code:

npm run format

If linting reports errors, review them and fix the source code. Then rerun the checks.

For a team workflow, these commands can also be added to Jenkins or GitHub Actions so code-quality checks run automatically whenever changes are pushed.

Important: Before running npm run format, use git status to check your current changes. Prettier may reformat many files at once.

Answer: It specifies files and directories that Prettier should skip when formatting. For example, node_modules/, generated reports, test results, and logs.

Q4. What is the purpose of eslint.config.js?

Answer: It defines ESLint configuration, including which files to check, which directories to ignore, JavaScript language options, recognized globals, and coding rules.

Q5. What is the difference between .prettierignore and eslint.config.js?

Answer: .prettierignore controls which files Prettier skips. eslint.config.js controls how ESLint analyzes files and which rules it applies. They serve different purposes.

Q6. What is the difference between npm run format and npm run format:check?

Answer: npm run format formats files and saves changes. npm run format:check checks whether files are formatted correctly without modifying them.

Q7. What is the difference between npm run lint and npm run lint:fix?

Answer: npm run lint reports linting issues. npm run lint:fix attempts to automatically fix issues that support safe automatic correction.

Q8. What does no-unused-vars do?

Answer: It reports declared variables, function parameters, or imports that are not used, depending on the rule configuration. It can be configured as a warning or an error.

Q9. What does no-undef do?

Answer: It reports references to identifiers that have not been declared or recognized as global variables.

Example:

console.log(usernme);

If usernme is not declared, ESLint can report it as an undefined variable.

Q10. What does sourceType: "module" mean?

Answer: It tells ESLint to parse the file as an ECMAScript module, supporting syntax such as import and export.

Q11. What does ecmaVersion: "latest" mean?

Answer: It allows ESLint to parse the latest ECMAScript syntax supported by the installed ESLint version.

Q12. What does "readonly" mean inside globals?

Answer: It tells ESLint that a variable is available in the runtime but should not be reassigned.

For example:

console.log("Test started");

Declaring console as a recognized read-only global prevents ESLint from incorrectly treating it as an undefined name.

Q13. Does ESLint execute Playwright test cases?

Answer: No. ESLint analyzes source code statically. Playwright executes browser automation tests and checks application behavior.

Q14. Does Prettier fix undefined variables?

Answer: No. Prettier formats code. ESLint can identify undefined variables through rules such as no-undef.

Q15. Can a Playwright test pass ESLint and still fail during execution?

Answer: Yes. For example, a locator might not match any element, an application might be unavailable, or an assertion might fail. Static analysis cannot guarantee runtime success.

Q16. Can a Playwright test pass even when ESLint reports an error?

Answer: Yes. ESLint and Playwright perform different checks. The test may execute successfully even when the source contains a linting violation. However, a CI pipeline can be configured to stop when linting fails.

Q17. Why should generated reports be ignored?

Answer: Generated reports and artifacts can contain many files that are not source code. Ignoring them reduces unnecessary processing and helps focus formatting and linting on maintainable project files.

Q18. What is the difference between .gitignore and .prettierignore?

Answer: .gitignore prevents matching untracked files from being added to Git by default. .prettierignore tells Prettier not to format matching files. Ignoring a file in one does not automatically ignore it in the other.

Q19. How do you integrate ESLint and Prettier into CI/CD?

Answer: Add commands such as npm run format:check and npm run lint as CI pipeline stages before test execution. Configure the pipeline to fail if these checks fail, then execute Playwright tests if the quality gates pass.

Q20. What would you do if npm run format reports “Missing script: format”?

Answer: I would check the scripts section of package.json, confirm that the format script exists, install Prettier as a development dependency if necessary, save the file, and run the command again.

Q21. How do you handle conflicts between ESLint and Prettier?

Answer: Use Prettier for formatting and ESLint for code-quality rules. If using formatting rules in ESLint causes conflicts, a common approach is to use eslint-config-prettier to disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier's formatting decisions.

Q22. What is the difference between a warning and an error in ESLint?

Answer: A warning indicates a configured issue at warning severity; an error indicates a configured issue at error severity. Whether a warning fails CI depends on the command and pipeline configuration. Errors generally produce a nonzero exit status.

Q23. What is a development dependency?

Answer: A development dependency is a package used for development tasks such as formatting, linting, testing, and building. It is generally installed using:

npm install --save-dev prettier eslint
Q24. Does --fix fix every ESLint problem?

Answer: No. It only fixes violations for which ESLint has an automatic fix. Some issues require manual changes because the correct fix depends on the developer's intent.

Q25. How do you maintain code quality in a Playwright framework?

Sample answer:

“I use Prettier to maintain consistent formatting and ESLint to detect common coding mistakes and enforce standards. I add format-check and lint scripts to package.json, configure ignore rules for generated artifacts, and run both checks in the CI/CD pipeline before executing the Playwright suite. I also review test results, logs, traces, and reports to investigate runtime failures.”

11. Common troubleshooting scenarios

Problem

What to check

Missing script: "format"

Confirm the format script exists in package.json

prettier: command not found

Install Prettier and verify dependencies are installed

ESLint reports no-undef

Check variable spelling, imports, declarations, and runtime globals

ESLint reports unused variables

Remove the variable or use it appropriately

Prettier formats generated reports

Verify .prettierignore is in the project root and patterns match

ESLint checks too many files

Review the files and ignores patterns

Formatting changes many files

Review git status and the diff before committing

ESLint and Prettier disagree on formatting

Consider eslint-config-prettier

12. Recommended framework setup

A simple configuration for your Playwright project

package.json

Stores npm scripts and project dependencies.

.prettierignore

Excludes generated files and dependencies from formatting.

eslint.config.js

Defines static analysis rules, language options, and exclusions.

CI/CD pipeline

Runs quality checks automatically before test execution.

Final revision points

Remember these five distinctions for interviews:

Prettier = formatting.

ESLint = static code analysis.

.prettierignore = files Prettier skips.

eslint.config.js = rules ESLint applies.

Playwright Test Runner = executes automation tests and verifies application behavior.
